# Trackpad Drawer
**Note**: this is in development

Note: this name is subject to change
## Goals
This is supposed to be a macos app allowing you to draw using the trackpad.
You are intended to be able to touch the trackpad,
and the app will draw at the associated location.

Currently, the planned features include:
- pen mode, with thickness option
- eraser, with thickness option
- palm rejection (sorta)
(if your finger or stylus (those usually work, right?)
touches the trackpad before your palm and is lifted after your palm,
your palm should be ignnored)

The features that may or may not be added are:
- fill
- colors (besides black and white)

Some way to integrate this into a LaTeX workflow
is likely to be made
(I plan to use this for diagrams in my notes).
If it is in it's own repository,
I will (hopefully) link it.
